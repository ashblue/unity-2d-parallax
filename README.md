# unity-2d-parallax
Fast, customizable, and easy to use toolset for 2D Parallaxing in Unity. To get
started simply import the Parallax2D package into your project. See the
"Examples" folder for implementation.

## Features
A few of the more impressive features include.

* Relative **automatic parallaxing calculations** with parallax groups. Simply define
the farthest and nearest layer. Let the calculations do the rest.
* Ability to **limit or wrap a boundary area** of a parallax group. Define boundaries for
multiple or a single layer.
* On started **simulate parallax movement** from a single point of origin. Great for 
simulating movement when enetering in from a specific side.
* **X and Y axis repeating image support**. Automatically repeat elements on the x or y axis by
adding a simple component to a parallax layer. Optimized with GameObject recycling for out of
view elements.
* **Relative camera particle FX**. Simulate particles moving at a specific parallax speed
with Unity's built-in particle system. Great for smoke, rain, embers, dust, ect.
